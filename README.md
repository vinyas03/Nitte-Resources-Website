# Nitte-Resources-Website
A responsive static website built using only HTML and CSS. It is developed for the students of our college for providing them with useful E-resources. I had made the website accessible via the domain - nitteres.tk . The website was launched in August 2022 and made it accessible for 12 months prior to expiration of the domain.
